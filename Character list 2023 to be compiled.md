> Giles et al. (2015): "Hanke	&	Davis	(2008)	express	uncertainty	about	bone	cell	lacunae	in	the	scale	bases	of	*Gladiobranchus*.	However,	Newman	et	al.	(2012),	working	on	the	basis	of	better-preserved	material	of	*Uraniacanthus* (to	which	*Gladiobranchus*	is	synonymous)	show	convincingly	that	these	lacunae	are	lacking.	*Climatius* is	scored	'?'	in	spite	of	Ørvig's	(1967)	report	of	acellular	bases.	Ørvig	figured	flat-based	scales	from	the head.	This	character	strictly	concerns	body	scales,	which	may	have	been	different.	*Cheirolepis* is	scored	'1'	based	on	Ørvig	(1967).	However,	this	is	remarkably	poorly	documented	in	any	accessioned	specimens.	*Acanthodes* is	scored	'1'	based	on	Gross	(1947)	and	Valiukevicius	(1995).	*Dialipina* is	scored	from	Schultze	(1968).	*Psarolepis* is	coded	'0'	based	on	Qu	et	al.	(2013).	The	presence	or	absence	of	bone	cells	in	the	scale	bases	of	*Brindabellaspis* is uncertain	based	on	Burrow	&	Turner	(1999)."

> Giles et al. (2015):" The	character	formulation	of	Davis	et	al.	(2012)	did	not	distinguish	between	ordered	arrangements	of	fin	scales	and	lepidotrichia.	Acanthodians	and	*Dialipina* (uncatalogued	specimen,	Musem	für	Naturkunde,	Berlin)	exhibit	fin	web	scales	that	are	not	markedly	distinguished	from	the	body	scales.	Fin	web	scales	of	*Dialipina* even	include	a	distinct	peg-and-socket	articulation.	This	character	thus	refers	to	the	alignment	only,	but	not	to	the	specialized	rectangle-shaped	scales	in	osteichthyans.	*Poracanthodes* is	changed	to	'?'	because	fin	webs	do	not	appear	to	be	preserved	in	articulated	specimens	(Valiukevicius	1992).	*Brachyacanthus* and	*Parexus* scored	'1'	(pers.	obs.

> Coates et al. (2018): "*Gladbachus* scale crowns consistently meet the multicuspid condition. *Gladbachus* scales have been described as placoderm-like (Burrow & Turner 2013; Brazeau & Friedman 2014) and appear to have increased in size by the addition of dentine tubercles. The resultant patterns resemble closely those identified as *Ohioaspis*, attributed to the rhenanid *Asterosteus* (Gross 1973; Denison 1978) and used in the present matrix to score scale characteristics for rhenanids *Gemuendina* and *Jagorina*. This growth mode is areal, used by Brazeau and Friedman (2014) to characterise complexes of 'appositionally joined odontodes'."

> *Entelognathus* scales bear appositionally joined odontodes (Cui et al. in review).

36. Body scale growth concentric: (0) absent; (1) present.

> Brazeau (2009): "Body scale odontodes growing in concentric “onion skin” pattern: absent (0); present (1). This characterises the generalised concentric growth of odontodes around a single scale primordium seen in many acanthodian-type taxa and often used to diagnose acanthodians as a group. Taxa for which the superimposed odontodes do not cover the top of the crown (i.e. *Brochoadmones* and *Poracanthodes*) are scored “0”."

> Davis et al. (2012): "This character is not equivalent the ‘superpositional’ character state used by Hanke & Wilson (2004). More precisely, it refers to the classic mode of acanthodian scale growth depicted in texts from Moy-Thomas & Miles (1971) onwards, and exemplified by *Acanthodes* and *Nostolepis* (shown again by Burrow & Turner 2010). Thus *Brochoadmones* (and similar taxa) coded by Hanke & Wilson (2004) and Burrow & Turner (2010) as sharing the same general superpositional mode of flank scale growth, is here coded as different (mid-sagittal sections of scales shown in Hanke & Wilson 2006)."

> Dearden et al. (2021): "As Miles (1973) observed, the flank scales of *Dobunnacanthus* gen. nov. are ornamented with anteroposteriorly aligned ridges (Fig. 13C, D). These appear to be very similar to the scales of *Vernicomacanthus*, with their laterally apposed odontodes. However, because the internal structure of the scales is not preserved, it is impossible to definitively diagnose this."

37. Body scales with peg-and-socket articulation: (0) absent; (1) present.

> The coding of *Andreolepis hedei* is changed from 1 to 0 (Chen et al., 2012). The coding of *Raynerius splendens* is changed from 1 to unapplicable because the scales are devoid necks (Giles et al., 2015 Fig. 2e). The coding of *Andreolepis hedei* is changed from 0 to 1 (Hank and Wilson, 2006 Fig. 8)

> The coding of *Entelognathus primordialis* is changed from unapplicable to 1 based on new data.

> Unknown in *Janusiscus schultzei*. The scales (GIT 496-8 to 496-16) are found from the same locality and horizon as the skull specimens (GIT 496-6, GIT496-7), but “cannot be definitely associated with cranial material” (Giles *et al*., 2015). Follow this statement, the scale features in *Janusiscus schultzei* are coded ‘unknown’ in all the later data sets. GIT 496-8 to 496-16 (http://geokogud.info/git/specimen_image/496/496-8.jpg to http://geokogud.info/git/specimen_image/496/496-16.jpg) show the presence of the peg-and-socket articulation, and the absence of the anterodoral process of the scale. This uncertainty also results in the drifting phylogenetic resolution of *Janusiscus schultzei* and could be clarified with the additional findings in the type locality and horizon.

Rudimentary postorbital processes are present in the rhenanid Jagorina (Stensio 1969: fig. 90) and the porolepiforms *Porolepis* and *Glyptolepis* (Jarvik 1972: figs 20-21).

> Giles et al. (2015)：“This character is modified from DFC characters 76 and 93. In part, this character describes patterns of variation among transverse otic processes that bear the hyomandibular facet (see characters 125 and 164). Transverse otic processes that lack a canal for the jugular are characteristic of many chondrichthyans (e.g. *Tamiobatis*, *Xenacanthus*). In cases where taxa lack a jugular canal and have a posteriorly positioned transverse otic process, this structure is typically called a lateral otic process (e.g. Schaeffer 1981: figs. 6, 21; Coates & Sequeira 1998: fig. 6). This character is composed as a compound because there are no further dependent characters. Mathematically, this should be equivalent to atomizing and using inapplicability.”

Certain early actinopterygians have an enclosed dorsal aorta and at least partially closed basicranial course for the lateral dorsal aortae (ref. 18, cf. fig 15). This may therefore be a gnathostome symplesiomorphy or simply highly variable."

Such a structure is present in many placoderms (the anterior postorbital process of traditional nomenclature), chondrichthyans (the lateral otic process), and osteichthyans (the lateral commisure sensu lato). There is some variability in the structure (pierced by jugular canal versus imperforate) and location (level with the anterior or posterior of the otic capsule) of transverse otic processes among early gnathostomes.

These ridges have not previously been recognized in other early gnathostomes prior to our observations in *Janusiscus*. It is apparent from our revised comparative anatomy of early gnathostome braincases that subcranial ridges are present in the braincase referred to *Ligulalepis*, where they are manifest as downturned margins of the ventral surface of the sphenoid (Basden & Young, 2001), and *Mimipiscis* (Gardiner, 1984: fig. 50), where they greatly reduced in length.”

> Giles et al. (2015): "Craniospinal	process:	large	process	extending	from the	posterolateral	corner	of	the	braincase,	bearing	a	distinct	craniospinal	ridge,	and	defining	the	posterior	margin	of	the	embayment	identified	by	Young	(1980)	as	the	cuccularis	fossa.	In	many	‘placoderms’,	this	endoskeletal	process	is	intimately	associated	with	the	dermal	craniothoracic	joint	(e.g.	Buchanosteus;	Young	1979:	fig.	2).	A	more	modest	posterolateral	extension	of	the	occipital	arch,	immediately	posterior	to	the	metotic fissure,	is	present	in	some	early	actinopterygians (e.g.	Mimipiscis;	Gardiner	1984:	fig.	2,	‘crsp’) and has	also	been	termed	a	craniospinal	process (first	by	Nielsen	1942).	A	low	prominence	is	present	in	a	comparable	location	in	Acanthodes	(Miles	1973:	pl.	5A,	‘pao.p’;	Davis	et	al.	2012:	supp.	fig.	9,	‘Pao.p’),	but	is	not	nearly as	well-developed	as	the	actinopterygian	or	‘placoderm’	craniospinal	processes, being	hardly	noticeable	in	revised	reconstructions	(Davis	et	al.	2012	supp.	fig.	15).	Miles	(1977:	55)	drew	parallels	between	transverse	occipital	processes	in	lungfishes	in	actinopterygian	craniospinal	processes,	but	remained circumspect	concerning	their	possible	homology.	Gardiner	(1984:	190)	regarded	the	dipnoan	and	actinopterygian	processes	as	non-homologous.		Despite	 similarities	 in	 orientation	 and	 position,	 the	 relationship	 between	 the craniospinal	processes	of	‘placoderms’	and	actinopterygians	is	obscure.	What	is	clear	is	that	the	craniospinal	processes	of	actinopterygians	are	proportionally	smaller	than,	and	in	some	ways	structurally	distinct	from,	the	processes	of	the	same	name	in	‘placoderms’.	However,	 we	 are	 not	 confident	 that	 their	 homology	 can	 be	 rejected	 a	 priori.	 We	therefore	consider	these	processes	primary	homologues,	with	this	hypothesis	subject	to	testing	 through	 congruence.	 This	 mirrors	 the	 strategy	 applied	 above	 for	 lateral	otic/transverse	 otic	 processes.	 Based	 on	 mapped	 character	 distributions,	 our	 analysis	rejects	 homology	 between	 the	 craniospinal	 processes	 of	 actinopterygians	 and	‘placoderms’	 (Extended	 Data	 Figure	 7m;	 cf.	 optimizations	 shown	 in	 Supplementary	Figure	1)."

> Giles et al. (2015): "This is admittedly a compound character. This owes to the problems of rendering ratio-scale continuous characters as a discrete character. Our conceptualisation of this character is intended to capture the distinctively broad or ribbon-shaped second dorsal fins that are differentiated from any of the other median fins, and the generalized triangular shape of many gnathostomes and their relatives. In taxa possessing only a single dorsal fin, we have scored taxa where we think the observed fin is equivalent to a posterior dorsal fin. This is based on the postition of the posterior dorsal fin behind or at the level of the posterior limit of the posterior wall of the body cavity (as indicated by the position of the pelvic girdle and/or anal fin, or evidence of the body cavity present as an infill). We have reinterpreted the vertebral column of *Cowralepis*, arguing that Ritchie's (2005) reconstruction inverts the dorsoventral orientation. Ritchie's sub-haemal spines are here interpreted as dorsal or caudal fin radials. This is evidenced by the fact that the series bearing these epi-spinal elements continues under the dermal shoulder armour, while the opposing series terminates at the level of the pelvic fins (based on AMF9764, Ritchie, 2005, fig. 16 A, B). This also better explains the direction of the gentle sigmoid bend seen in several specimens (Ritchie, 2005, figs.16B, 17A, C). In photographs of specimen AMF103767 (Ritchie, 2005, fig. 1A-D, the orientation of the collapsed vertebral column can be observed. In the specimen showing the dorsal surface, the chordal surface the series lacking the accessory elements is observed, suggesting this was their ventral surface rather than dorsal."
